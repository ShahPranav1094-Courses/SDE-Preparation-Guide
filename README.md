# SDE Preparation Guide

##### Disclaimer : None of the courses have been curated by me. This is just an attempt to gather all the material at one place. This is the exact same material that I had used for my preparation and in no way I am promoting or neglecting any particular YouTuber. Almost all the content is free except one course which I have stated explicitly.


### You must devote atleast 1-2 hrs daily over a period of 3-6 months for preparation.
### Consistency is the key. No Cheating :-P

## *Let's Begin*


#### Pre-requisites

- You should have good command over atleast one object oriented programming language. 
- No need to know 3-4 languages only 1 is sufficient for interview purpose
- Tech gaint company interviews are mostly language agnostic
- If you wish to master a particular object oriented language then just check on YouTube you will be able to find a lot of free and quality content.
  
#### Printing Patterns
- Before jumping to problem solving try to print a lot of patterns like Diamond, Star, Number series, Reverse Diamond etc.
- This will help you to master the iterations in the loops and also give you confidence on the index ranges. This is going to be very important for problem solving.
- You can also explore all types of loops while doing this activity and note the differences between them.
  
#### Mastering DS and Algorithms
- For Problem Solving it is very important to know the data structures and then time complexities in detail.
- Although it is recommended to use STL in coding interviews, it is good to know the internal implementation of all the data structures as it will help you to understand time complexities at ease.

#### STL
- It is very important to know STL usage in coding interviews. There is no time to define our own data structures.
- You should have enough practice on all the STL datastructures without intellisense.
- [STL in C++](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-stl-cpp)


#### Pointers in C++
- Mastering pointers is very important for topics like LinkedList, Trees & Graphs.
- Pointers seem to be very scary at first but trust me they are not. Go through the below playlist for better understanding.
- Always create memory blocks when it comes to pointers that will help you visualize things very easily.

## Problem Solving

- There are lot of topics to be covered. It is recommended to follow the order.
  
#### Binary Search
- Whenever the input is in sorted order then there are high chances of applying binary search.
- Questions on Binary Search are very frequently asked on telephonic and pre-screening interviews.

#### Sliding window
- Sliding window is a very very important topic.
- I have been asked questions on this topic in almost 8 interviews.
- It is a humble request to go through the below playlist in detail.

#### Stack
- There are very famous questions on stacks like Min Stack, Largest Area in Histogram, Balanced Paranthesis etc. and it is recommended to go through them all.
- Also, Stack is a very useful tool for questions on Tree traversals.

#### Heap
- Whenever you are asked to find highest or lowest 'n' elements then thought of using Heap should strike to us. 
- In C++, Priority_Queue data structure from STL can be used.
- Also, priority_queue is also used mainly in problems related to intervals. E.g. Merge intervals, Minimum Number of meeting rooms, Meeting Rooms II etc.

#### Recursion
- A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems
- No one is directly going to ask questions on recursion directly in an interview.
- However, recursion is a key factor for solving problems on LinkedList, Trees, Graphs and Dynamic Programming(DP)
- Try to draw recursion trees for few problems this will give a lot of clarity and you will never be confused on the base case scenarios and will be able to handle recursion problems very easily.

#### LinkedList
- Like Binary Search, Linkedlist questions are mostly asked only in telephonic or screening interviews.
- There are some famous quesitons like Middle of LL, Remove Nth node from end of LL, Reverse LL, LL Cycle etc.
- Make sure you are good at pointers and recursion before attempting problems on LL.
- Also, understanding LL will help you to solve problems on Trees

### Trees
- Trees is another important topic which is very frequently asked in interviews.
- We can expect atleast one question on trees in one of the DS algo rounds.
- Trees have a lot of depth. However, you can only focus on Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees from interview point of view.
- It is good to know what and how Red-Black Trees, 2-3-4 Trees, AVL trees are implemented.
- There are a lot of questions based on tree traversals
- You must know inorder, preorder, postorder and level order traversal of trees.
- Also, most of the questions on trees involve recursion. So please master recursion before attempting any problem on trees.

#### Graphs
- Graphs is another topic similar to DP which seems to be very tough at first glance. But, you can decode it very easily with enough practice.
- BFS and DFS are the pillars of any graph problem.
- Personally I had referred to CP algorithm book(link below) for understanding graphs. It has list of questions associated for each sub-topics. Also the way they have explained identification of back edges and articulation points is very descriptive and easy to understand.

#### DP (Dynamic Programming)
- DP is just an extension of recursion with some temporary storage.
- With enough practice you can master DP.
- Once, you are able to solve questions on DP then trust me your confidence in coding interviews will be on another level.
- DP has lot of patterns like 0/1 knapsack, unbounded Knapsack, Grids, Trees, Stocks & MCM etc.
