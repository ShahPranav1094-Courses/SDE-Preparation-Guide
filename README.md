# SDE Preparation Guide

##### Disclaimer : None of the courses have been curated by me. This is just an attempt to gather all the material at one place. This is the exact same material that I had used for my preparation and in no way I am promoting or neglecting any particular YouTuber. Almost all the content is free except one course which I have stated explicitly.


### You must devote atleast 1-2 hrs daily over a period of 3-6 months for preparation.
### Consistency is the key. No Cheating :-P

## *Let's Begin*


#### Pre-requisites

- You should have good command over atleast one object oriented programming language. 
- No need to know 3-4 languages only 1 is sufficient for interview purpose
- Big companies are mostly language agnostic
- If you wish to master a particular object oriented language then just check on YouTube you will be able to find a lot of free and quality content.
  
#### Printing Patterns
- Before jumping to problem solving try to print a lot of patterns like Diamond, Star, Number series, Reverse Diamond etc.
- This will help you to master the iterations in the loops and also give you confidence on the index ranges. This is going to be very important for problem solving.
- You can also explore all types of loops while doing this activity and note the differences between them.
  
#### Mastering DS and Algorithms
- For Problem Solving it is very important to know the data structures and then time complexities in detail.
- Although it is recommended to use STL in coding interviews, it is good to know the internal implementation of all the data structures as it will help you to understand time complexities at ease.

#### STL
- It is very important to know STL usage in coding interviews. There is no time to define our own data structures.
- [STL in C++](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-stl-cpp)


#### Pointers in C++
- Mastering pointers is very important for topics like LinkedList, Trees & Graphs.
- Pointers seem to be very scary at first but trust me they are not. Go through the below playlist for better understanding.
- Always create memory blocks when it comes to pointers that will help you visualize things very easily.

## Problem Solving

- There are lot of topics to be covered. It is recommended to follow the order.
  
#### Binary Search
- Whenever the input is in sorted order then there are high chances of applying binary search.
- Questions on Binary Search are very frequently asked on telephonic and pre-screening interviews.

#### Sliding window
- Sliding window is a very very important topic.
- I have been asked questions on this topic in almost 8 interviews.
- It is a humble request to go through the below playlist in detail.

#### Stack
- There are very famous questions on stacks like Min Stack, Largest Area in Histogram, Balanced Paranthesis etc. and it is recommended to go through them all.
- Also, Stack is a very useful tool for questions on Tree traversals.

#### Heap
- Whenever you are asked to find highest or lowest 'n' elements then thought of using Heap should strike to us. 
- In C++ Priority_Queue data structure from STL can be used.

#### LinkedList
- Like Binary Search, Linkedlist questions are mostly asked only in telephonic or screening interviews.
- There are some famous quesitons like Middle of LL, Remove Nth node from end of LL, Reverse LL, LL Cycle etc.
- Make sure you are good at pointers before attempting problems on LL.
- Also, understanding LL will help you to solve problems on Trees
