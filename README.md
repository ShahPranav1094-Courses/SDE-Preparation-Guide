# SDE-Preparation-Guide

## You must devote atleast 1-2 hrs on daily basis over a period of 3-6 months for preparation. 
## Consistency & Patience is the key. No Cheating!!!

### Disclaimer : None of the courses have been curated by me. This is just an attempt to gather all the material at one place. This is the exact same material that I had used for my preparation and in no way I am promoting or neglecting any particular YouTuber. Almost entire content is free except one course which I have stated explicitly.

## Pre-requisites
- You should have good command over one object oriented programming language. No need to know 3-4 languages only 1 is sufficient for interview purpose
- Tech gaint company interviews are mostly language agnostic
- If you wish to master a particular object oriented language then just check on YouTube and you will be able to find a lot of free and quality content.
  
## Printing Patterns
- Before jumping to problem solving try to print a lot of patterns like Diamond, Star, Number series, Reverse Diamond etc.
- This will help you to master the iterations in the loops and also give you confidence on the index ranges. This is going to be very important for problem solving.
- You can also explore all types of loops while doing this activity and note the differences between them.
  
## Mastering DS and Algorithms
- For Problem Solving it is very important to know the data structures and their time complexities in detail.
- Although it is recommended to use STL in coding interviews, it is good to know the internal implementation of all the data structures as it will help you to understand time complexities at ease.

## STL
- It is very important to know STL usage in coding interviews. There is no time to define our own data structures.
- You should have enough practice on all the STL data structures without using any intellisense.
- [STL in C++](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-stl-cpp)


## Pointers in C++
- Mastering pointers is very important for topics like LinkedList, Trees & Graphs.
- Pointers seem to be very scary at first but trust me they are not. Go through the below playlist for better understanding.
- Always create memory blocks when it comes to pointers that will help you visualize things very easily.

# Problem Solving

- There are lot of topics to be covered. It is recommended to follow the order.
  
## Binary Search
- Whenever the input is in sorted order then there are high chances of applying binary search.
- Questions on Binary Search are very frequently asked on telephonic and pre-screening interviews.
- [Binary Search Playlist - 1](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-binarysearch)
- [Binary Search Playlist - 2](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-binarysearch-2)

## Sliding window
- Sliding window is a very very important topic.
- I have been asked questions on this topic in almost 8-10 interviews.
- It is a humble request to go through the below playlist in detail.
- [Sliding Window Playlist](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-slidingwindow) (***Must Do***)


## Stack
- There are very famous questions on stacks like Min Stack, Largest Area in Histogram, Balanced Paranthesis etc. and it is recommended to go through them all.
- Also, Stack is a very useful tool for questions on Tree traversals.
- [Stack Playlist - 1](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-stack)
- [Stack Playlist - 2](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-stack-2)

## Heap
- Whenever you are asked to find highest or lowest 'n' elements then thought of using Heap should strike to us. 
- In C++, Priority_Queue data structure from STL can be used.
- Also, priority_queue is also used mainly in problems related to intervals. E.g. Merge intervals, Minimum Number of meeting rooms, Meeting Rooms II etc.
- Queue is also used mainly for BFS traversal of Trees & Graphs.
- [Heap Playlist](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-heap)

## Recursion
- A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems
- No one is directly going to ask questions on recursion in an interview.
- However, recursion is a key factor for solving problems on LinkedList, Trees, Graphs and Dynamic Programming(DP)
- Try to draw recursion trees for few problems this will give you a lot of clarity and you will never be confused on the base case scenarios and will be able to handle recursion problems very easily.

-  [Recursion Playlist - 2](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-recursion-2)


## LinkedList
- Like Binary Search, Linkedlist questions are mostly asked only in telephonic or screening interviews.
- There are some famous quesitons like Middle of LL, Remove Nth node from end of LL, Reverse LL, LL Cycle etc.
- Make sure you are good at pointers and recursion before attempting problems on LL.
- Also, understanding LL will help you to solve problems on Trees
- [LinkedList Playlist](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-linkedlist)


## Trees
- Trees is another important topic which is very frequently asked in interviews.
- We can expect atleast one question on trees in one of the DS algo rounds.
- Trees have a lot of depth. However, you can only focus on Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees from interview point of view.
- It is good to know what and how Red-Black Trees, 2-3-4 Trees, AVL Trees, Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees are implemented.
- There are a lot of questions based on tree traversals
- You must know inorder, preorder, postorder and level order traversal of trees.
- Also, most of the questions on trees involve recursion. So please master recursion before attempting any problems on trees.

## Graphs
- Graphs is another topic similar to DP which seems to be very tough at first glance. But, you can decode it very easily with enough practice.
- BFS and DFS are the pillars of any graph problem.
- Personally I had referred to CP algorithm book(link below) for understanding graph theory. It has list of questions associated for each sub-topics. Also the way they have explained identification of back edges and articulation points is very descriptive and easy to understand.

- [CP Algorithm Book](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-graph-cp)

## DP (Dynamic Programming)
- DP is just an extension of recursion with some temporary storage.
- With enough practice you can master DP.
- Once, you are able to solve questions on DP then trust me your confidence in coding interviews will be on another level.
- DP has lot of patterns like 0/1 knapsack, unbounded Knapsack, Grids, Trees, Stocks & MCM etc.

## Trie
- Trie is an advance data structure but very useful in problems related to strings.
- It is very easy to understand Trie if you are good at LinkedList.
- One of its main application is to provide fast word searches in long paragraphs.

## SDE Problems Sheet
- After completing all the topics you can refer Strivers SDE sheet which contains 150 most likely asked questions.
- Again this is just for reference and no guarantee that questions will only be asked from it.

# Design Patterns
- Design patterns are very important toolset to have in object oriented interviews or Low level design interviews.
- Some of the interviewers do ask a particular design pattern and also ask you to implement it with a real life scenario.
- Below playlist explains the design patterns from `Head First Design Patterns` book
- [Design Patterns Playlist](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-designpatterns)

# Low Level Design
- In LLD interviews we are expected to provide a working code for a given problem.
- Apart from Algorithm for the problem, the way we define classes, approriate use of Data structures and design patterns matters a lot.
- Try to create UML diagrams from some sample questions like SnakeLadder, RideShare, BMS, Library Management System etc. 
- [Low Level Design Playlist](https://tinyurl.com/shahpranav1094-lld)

# System Design
- System Design is a very open ended interview. There is no one correct solution.
- Ask as many questions as you have to get better understanding of the problem.
- Note down the functional and non-functional requirements.
- Do the back of the envelope calculation if needed.
- Start with simple system and then scale up as needed.
- Database selection matters a lot. Your entire interview efforts can go in vain if you propose wrong database.
- Draw block diagrams of all the components that you want your system to have. Draw.io is a very handy tool for it.
- Ensure that the final design doesn't have any single point of failures and also it should be easily scalable.
